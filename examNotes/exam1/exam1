____________________________________________________________________________________
A. Basics
I. definitions:
big-oh: f(n) is O(g(n)) iff for some constant c and n0, such that f(n)<=c*g(n), for n>=n0, c>0, n0>=0.

big-omega: f(n) is O(g(n)) iff for some constant c and n0, such that f(n)>=c*g(n), for n>=n0, c>0, n0>=0.

big-theta: f(n) is O(g(n)) iff for some constant c1, c2, and n0, such that f(n)<=c1*g(n), and f(n)>=c*g(n), for n>=n0, c>0, n0>=0.

II. graph:
x-axis: values of n
y-axis: values of f(n), g(n), which represents execution time.

B. prove techniques
big-oh:
n0=1, c=sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of f(n)
big-omega:
c=ak/2, n0 is any integer greater than max(1, 2/ak(ak-1 + ... + a2 + a1 + a0))

C. Application:
I. ram model:
	*Each simple operation (+, -, *, /, =, if, call) takes exactly one time step
	*Each memory access takes exactly one time step.
	*We have as much as memory as we need.
	*No notice of whether an item is in cache or on the disk.
II. ram model vs actual:
	*Limited memory.
	*Multiplication takes more time than addition.
	*Cache access takes less time than disk access.
III. WCET, BCET, ACET:
O, omega, theta.

IV. problem complexity & algorithmic complexity:
problem complexity is the lower bound of algorithmic complexity

D. Dominance Relationships

n^n >> n! >> 2^n >> n^3 >> n^2 >> nlogn >> n >> logn >> 1

2. data structures
____________________________________________________________________________________
A. Basic
I. array:
	*constant time access given the index
	*space efficient
	*memory locality
II. linked list:
	*each node contain one or more data fields
	*each node contains a pointer field to at least one other node.
	*a pointer that points to the head of the list
III. array vs linked list:
array advantages:
	*size of an array is fixed
	*constant time access given the index
	*space efficient
	*memory locality (no need for storing pointers)
	
linked list advatages:
	*change size on the go (no overflow)
	*insertion and deletion are simpler
	*for large amount of data, moving pointers are faster than moving data.
	*not efficient random access
B. Basic abstract data types
I. stack:
	*LIFO
	*push(x,s): insert item x at the top of stack s.
	*pop(s): return (and remove) the top item of stack s.
II. queue:
	*FIFO
	*enqueue(x,q): insert item x at the back of queue q.
	*dequeue(q): return (and remove) the front item from queue q.
C. Execution time for everything:

3. p-np
____________________________________________________________________________________
A. intro concepts
B. classes of problems
I. Undecidable (prove halting problem is undecidable)
	definition: can prove that there are no algorithms possible to solve it.
	*halting problem prove:
	
II.Provable intractable
	definition: can prove that there is no polynominal algorithm to solve it.
	*Hamiltonian Cycle Enumeration Problem
III. Probably intractable (NP) 
	definition: cannot prove that there are no polynomial algorithms to solve it. All existing algorithms are non-polynominal.
	*Hamiltonian Cycle Search Problem
	*independent set problem
	*check if an answer is correct
IV. P (easy to solve)
	definition: there is a polynominal algorithm to solve it.
	*find the largest number in an integer array of size 100.

4. proof techniques (form is important!)
____________________________________________________________________________________
A. job selection problem
B. calculus
C. different techniques
D. Examples in class
I. contradiction:
	the halting problem prove:
	Assume that there exist an algorithm such that can solve the halting problem
II. induction:
	basic step: n = min, holds
	induction hypothesis: Assume holds for n=k
	induction step: prove k+1 holds
III. direct proof:
IV. vacuous & trivial proof:
|P|Q|P->Q| 
|T|T|  T |
|T|F|  F |
|F|T|  T |
|F|F|  T |
vacuous: P is false, P->Q is true
trivial: Q is true, P->Q is true
V. contrapositve:
|~P|~Q|~Q->~p| 
|F |F |   T  |
|F |T |   F  |
|T |F |   T  |
|T |T |   T  |

A. brute force techniques

Backtrack-DFS(A,k):
if A=(a1,a2,...,ak) is a solution, report it.
else
	k=k+1
	compute Sk
	while Sk!=0 do
		ak= an element in Sk
		Sk=Sk-ak
		Backtrack-DFS(A,k)
